# # Generate videos from prompts with Lightricks LTX-Video

# This example demonstrates how to run the [LTX-Video](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video)
# video generation model by [Lightricks](https://www.lightricks.com/) on Modal.

# LTX-Video is fast! Generating a twenty second 480p video at moderate quality
# takes as little as two seconds on a warm container.

# Here's one that we generated:

# <center>
# <video controls autoplay loop muted>
# <source src="https://modal-cdn.com/blonde-woman-blinking.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
# </video>
# </center>

# ## Setup

# We start by importing dependencies we need locally,
# defining a Modal [App](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps),
# and defining the container [Image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/images)
# that our video model will run in.

# ## Storing data on Modal Volumes

# On Modal, we save large or expensive-to-compute data to
# [distributed Volumes](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes)
# that are accessible both locally and remotely.

# We'll store the LTX-Video model's weights and the outputs we generate
# on Modal Volumes.

# We store the outputs on a Modal Volume so that clients
# don't need to sit around waiting for the video to be generated.

VOLUME_NAME = "ltx-outputs"
outputs = modal.Volume.from_name(VOLUME_NAME, create_if_missing=True)
OUTPUTS_PATH = Path("/outputs")

# We store the weights on a Modal Volume so that we don't
# have to fetch them from the Hugging Face Hub every time
# a container boots. This download takes about two minutes,
# depending on traffic and network speed.

MODEL_VOLUME_NAME = "ltx-model"
model = modal.Volume.from_name(MODEL_VOLUME_NAME, create_if_missing=True)

# We don't have to change any of the Hugging Face code to do this --
# we just set the location of Hugging Face's cache to be on a Volume
# using the `HF_HOME` environment variable.

MODEL_PATH = Path("/models")
image = image.env({"HF_HOME": str(MODEL_PATH)})

# For more on storing Modal weights on Modal, see
# [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights).


# ## Setting up our LTX class

# We use the `@cls` decorator to specify the infrastructure our inference function needs,
# as defined above.

# That decorator also gives us control over the
# [lifecycle](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions)
# of our cloud container.

# Specifically, we use the `enter` method to load the model into GPU memory
# (from the Volume if it's present or the Hub if it's not)
# before the container is marked ready for inputs.

# This helps reduce tail latencies caused by cold starts.
# For details and more tips, see [this guide](https://modal.com/guide/cold-start).

# The actual inference code is in a `modal.method` of the class.

# ## Generate videos from the command line

# We trigger LTX-Video inference from our local machine by running the code in
# the local entrypoint below with `modal run`.

# It will spin up a new replica to generate a video.
# Then it will, by default, generate a second video to demonstrate
# the lower latency when hitting a warm container.

# You can trigger inference with:

# ```bash
# modal run ltx
# ```

# All outputs are saved both locally and on a Modal Volume.
# You can explore the contents of Modal Volumes from your Modal Dashboard
# or from the command line with the `modal volume` command.

# ```bash
# modal volume ls ltx-outputs
# ```

# See `modal volume --help` for details.

# Optional command line flags for the script can be viewed with:

# ```bash
# modal run ltx --help
# ```

# Using these flags, you can tweak your generation from the command line:

# ```bash
# modal run --detach ltx --prompt="a cat playing drums in a jazz ensemble" --num-inference-steps=64
# ```
